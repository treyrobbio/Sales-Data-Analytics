# Sales-Data-Analytics

This project analyzes retail sales, profitability, customer behavior, and shipping performance using the Superstore dataset. I used MySQL to build 10 analytical datasets (CTEs, window functions, aggregations, and profitability metrics) and visualized them in a four-page Power BI dashboard.

The dashboard covers sales trends, regional and state performance, top customers and products, shipping efficiency, late-order detection, and profit margin analysis. This project demonstrates end-to-end skills in SQL, data cleaning, and building interactive Power BI reports that turn raw sales data into actionable insights.
