# Sales-Data-Analytics

This project analyzes retail sales, profitability, customer behavior, and shipping performance using the Superstore dataset. I used MySQL to generate 10 analytical datasets—built with CTEs, window functions, and aggregation logic—and visualized them in a four-page Power BI dashboard.

The dashboard (included in sales_dashboard.pbix and sales_dashboard.pdf) covers sales trends, regional performance, top customers and products, shipping efficiency, late-order detection, and profit-margin analysis. All SQL used to create the datasets is included in Sales_Data.sql. This project demonstrates end-to-end analytical skills across SQL, data cleaning, and interactive Power BI reporting.
